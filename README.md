High Impact clone website is a clone of a highly reputable EdTech Consulting
Firm official website(https://highimpactcareers.co.uk/), The live clone is 
on this (https://highimpactwebsite-clone.vercel.app).

I use Vue.js, Vue Router and Pinia to execute this project. Vue.js was considered
mostly because it is used to build single page applications, which helps to load the
page faster.

Tailwind css was used for styling the whole project, mostly because of its simplicity
and its mobile responsiveness features.

I used third parties libraries such as formkit(form validation and control), currency.js
(for the shopping feature of the app, as it has an online store), etc.

More features can be added to this task, such as changing preferred currency, etc.
