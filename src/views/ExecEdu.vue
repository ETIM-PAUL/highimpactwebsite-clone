              Organisational culture, once established, has important influences
              on the strategy of an organisation. Although a judiciously shaped
              strategy may make or break a company, the influence of the
              organisational culture is paramount because it may make or break
              the strategy. Importantly, a weak organisational culture is a
              recipe for inefficiency, poor performance and below-par service
              delivery. We will look at the challenges posed by local cultural
              values and norms and discuss their impact on your organisational
              strategy, processes, and the delivery of service in your
              organisation.

              A company’s strategy is its plan for victory over rivals and
              competitors while strategic management is the process of
              formulating and implementing a strategy. Strategy encapsulates the
              decisions, actions, direction, and scope of an organisation over
              the long-term. It also involves the allocation of resources to
              enhance performance and achieve set goals.
