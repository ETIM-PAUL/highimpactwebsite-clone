            LinkedIn is the world’s largest professional network with over 500
            million users. It has become a popular talent hunting place for
            companies, recruiters, and head-hunters. The number one activity on
            LinkedIn is viewing profiles, so you need to craft a profile that
            stands out and attract potential employers. Below, I highlight tips
            and hints on how you can turn your LinkedIn profile into a powerful
            marketing tool which can be used in advancing your career.
