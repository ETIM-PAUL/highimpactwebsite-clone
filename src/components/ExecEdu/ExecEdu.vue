      Organisational culture, once established, has important influences on the
      strategy of an organisation. Although a judiciously shaped strategy may
      make or break a company, the influence of the organisational culture is
      paramount because it may make or break the strategy. Importantly, a weak
      organisational culture is a recipe for inefficiency, poor performance and
      below-par service delivery. We will look at the challenges posed by local
      cultural values and norms and discuss their impact on your organisational
      strategy, processes, and the delivery of service in your organisation.
